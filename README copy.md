## Hello ðŸ‘‹ Please find instructions below


- Start by downloading the repo.
- In your terminal; Composer installing & npm install.
- Copy the .env.example and create .env
- Set up your database (I use TablePlus). I named my connection laravel_react_app
- Php artisan migrate. To migrate the database.
- Next, you want to spin up your local servers.
- If using valet you can use your laravel app name & add .test on the end. If not php artisan serve will work. You should see port 8000, unless already in use.
- Secondly you'll want to start your React server.
- In your terminal, cd into react. Type npm run dev and this should start the server on port 3000, or in my case today, 5174.
